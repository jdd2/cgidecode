Sep 11, 2015	Release 1.0

cgidecode unpacks url-encoded or multipart-encoded data and mades it
available to shell scripts, via files.

Why would you want this?  It takes care of the parsing, letting you write
very simple CGIs in your favourite scripting language, e.g.  sh.

Installation: compile via "make".  Configure via editing Makefile. This
software requires a version of lex (e.g. flex), and the generation of the
manual pages requires a C preprocessor (cpp), which can sometimes be in an
odd location (e.g. /usr/ccs/lib/cpp on Solaris).  Install the executable by
hand in your chosen location, and, if you wish, the manual page, cgidecode.1

It's been tested on Linux, Solaris, OpenBSD, and Windows/Cygwin, and should run
on pretty much any UNIX-like system.

Comments, bug reports, fixes, enhancements, etc. are welcome.
